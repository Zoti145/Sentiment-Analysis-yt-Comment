# Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments: A Comprehensive Study of Machine Learning Models
## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we perform **sentiment analysis** on YouTube comments to classify them into multiple categories.  
The dataset consists of preprocessed comments (stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization).  
Several **machine learning and deep learning models** are trained and compared for performance.

The task is a **multi-class classification problem**, where comments are classified into:  

* Positive  
* Negative  
* Neutral  

## 🛠️ Installing software and files

We implement the project in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook**.  
First, download and install **Anaconda** which provides Jupyter Notebook and essential packages.

- Download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download  
- Installation Guide: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-anaconda-on-windows/  

Once Anaconda is installed, you can launch Jupyter Notebook for coding.

## 📦 Installing Python libraries and packages

We used the following Python libraries for sentiment analysis:

* NumPy  
* Pandas  
* Scikit-learn  
* NLTK  
* Matplotlib / Seaborn  
* TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning models)
